                <h1>Oxygen gas</h1>
                <p>Oxygen is a chemical element with an atomic number of 8 (it has eight protons in its nucleus). Oxygen
                    forms a molecule (O2) of two atoms which is a colorless gas at normal temperatures and pressures.
                    Four representations chemists use for molecular oxygen. In the colored models, oxygen is
                    traditionally shown as red.</p>

            <div class="two">
                <h1>Carbondioxide gas</h1>
                <p>Carbon dioxide (commonly abbreviated as CO2) is a clear gas composed of one atom of carbon (C) and
                    two atoms of oxygen (O). Carbon dioxide is one of many molecules where carbon is commonly found on
                    the Earth. It does not burn, and in standard temperature and pressure conditions it is stable,
                    inert, and non-toxic</p>
            </div>
            <div class="three">
                <h1>Nitrogen gas</h1>
                <p>nitrogen (N), nonmetallic element of Group 15 [Va] of the periodic table. It is a colourless,
                    odourless, tasteless gas that is the most plentiful element in Earth's atmosphere and is a
                    constituent of all living matter</p>
            </div>
            <div class="four">
                <h1>Hydrogen gas</h1>
                <p>Hydrogen is a clean alternative to methane, also known as natural gas. It's the most abundant
                    chemical element, estimated to contribute 75% of the mass of the universe. Here on earth, vast
                    numbers of hydrogen atoms are contained in water, plants, animals and, of course, humans.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="five">
                <h1>Ammonia</h1>
                <p>Ammonia is a colorless highly irritating gas with a sharp suffocating odor. It dissolves easily in
                    water to form ammonium hydroxide solution which can cause irritation and burns. Ammonia gas is
                    easily compressed and forms a clear, colorless liquid under pressure.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="six">
                <h1>Methane</h1>
                <p> Methane (CH4) is a colorless, odorless and highly flammable gas. It is composed of carbon and
                    hydrogen. It is also a potent greenhouse gas, meaning it affects climate change by contributing to
                    increased warming, according to the US Environmental Protection Agency</p>
